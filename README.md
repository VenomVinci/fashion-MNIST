# Fashion-MNIST Classification with PyTorch


This project implements a deep learning model using **PyTorch** to classify images from the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).
It was developed and trained in **Google Colab**, achieving strong accuracy on both training and test datasets.

---

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a neural network that classifies grayscale images of clothing items into one of **10 categories** (e.g., T-shirt, trousers, shoes).
The dataset is more challenging than the original MNIST digits dataset, making it a great benchmark for image classification.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.10+**
* **PyTorch** for deep learning
* **Torchvision** for dataset handling and transformations
* **Google Colab** for training and experimentation
* **NumPy / Pandas** for numerical and data handling
* **Matplotlib** for visualization

---

## üìä Dataset

* **Fashion-MNIST** (60,000 training images, 10,000 test images)
* Each image: `28x28` grayscale
* Classes (10 categories):

  1. T-shirt/top
  2. Trouser
  3. Pullover
  4. Dress
  5. Coat
  6. Sandal
  7. Shirt
  8. Sneaker
  9. Bag
  10. Ankle boot

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The neural network consists of:

* Input Layer: 784 neurons (flattened 28√ó28 pixels)
* Hidden Layers: Fully connected layers with ReLU activation
* Dropout for regularization
* Output Layer: 10 neurons (one per class) with Softmax

Optimizer & Loss:

* **Optimizer**: Adam
* **Loss Function**: CrossEntropyLoss

---

## ‚ö° Training & Results

* **Train Accuracy**: `93.90%`
* **Test Accuracy**: `88.62%`
* Training was done on GPU (Colab) for faster convergence.
* Accuracy and loss curves show good generalization with minimal overfitting.

## üìà Example Predictions

The model correctly classifies most samples, though challenging categories (e.g., Shirt vs. T-shirt) sometimes cause confusion.
